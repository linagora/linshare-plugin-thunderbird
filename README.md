# LinShare plugin for Thunderbird

This plugin allows you to upload and share large files within Thunderbird just
by writing a new mail. There is a new button in the compose window named
'Send and Share' next to the original button "Send". When this button is pressed,
the plugin will upload attachments and share them with the recipients of the
current mail before sending the original mail without attachments.


This plugin works with :

* LinShare : 0.9.x to 1.12.x
* Thunderbird : 3.x to 45.x
